# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
This analysis looks at PyBer ride data by city type and offers recommendations for using the data to adjust the strategy at PyBer.
## Results
From the chart below you can see that most of the PyBer rides, revenue and drivers are in urban areas. In looking at the average fare per driver, compared with average fare per ride, it seems like there many more drivers in the urban area, which is causing the fare per driver for urban areas to be so low. As expected, the average fare per ride is more in suburban and rural areas than the urban area. I expect this is because surburban and rural travelers are going longer distances, perhaps to the urban portions of the city. In looking at at the trend over the last few months, there is not much of a change.

## Summary
Because there are so many more drivers in the urban areas than suburban and rural areas, I would want to further investigate how long customers wait for rides in these areas compared to urban areas. My hypothesis is if there are more suburban and rural drivers, then the wait times would go down and these customers might see PyBer as a better alternative to driving.

Also, noticing that the cost per ride is higher in suburban areas, I would work with local businesses, like bars and restaurants, to advertise a special discount for their customers to use PyBer to see if we could get the volume of riders up in suburban areas. At the same time we would need to offer incentives for drivers in suburban areas to work in these areas or communicate we are running a special in suburban areas and their fares per ride in suburban areas will go up.

PyBer could also consider a similar strategy for rural areas, offering discounts for common destinations, at certain times of the week, for rural customers and also advertising that the wait time for rides will be less because we are adding drivers to the area. Again, we would need to incent drivers to service these rural areas for a specified time to determine if this strategy would increase the ridership, and revenue, in rural areas.
